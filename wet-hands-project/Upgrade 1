Decided to have an Arduino controlled logic for the project with LCD display to show the "wet hands" message.
Opened VS Code and installed PlatformIO and wrote a code for LED with a delay of 500s.
Surfed a bit and found out that Arduino UNO library can be installed from sites such as engineering projects(note: sign up to get the link for zip folder)
